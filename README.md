# NASA Space Apps 2021- Realtime Space Trash Tracker 🚀 #
## Motivation ##
We, Debris_Mappers have built the frontend in ReactJS, an open source JavaScript library to build user interfaces. We had the rich NASA ⭐ WorldWind for Web library to display a beautiful globe to map space trash. We wanted to add some features like showing popups, a timer to periodically refetch data. Doing all this in VanillaJS would be a cumbersome task 🤦. Hence, we decided to go for ReactJS.
## Approach ##
Using the WorldWindJS library and the useEffect hook, we loaded the globe onto a canvas component. There was a panel on the side from where the user could select the class of his debris. Based on the files, tle.js and id.js, and the great library satellite.js we were able to plot the debris on a map 🗑. However, currently we have not enabled realtime mapping functionality and plan to add it in the due course of the challenge. The clock time is being incremented using the useInterval hook.
